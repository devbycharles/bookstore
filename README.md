# e-commerce

## Project
- This is an e-commerce website made to showcase my ability to develop a responsive landing page with products listed. Provides support for search engine optimization for higher indexing through Googleâ€™s search engine crawler. The entirety of the project was developed by me without following a guide.
- Design assets can be viewed here https://frontendsimplified.com/projects/ecommerce

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript ES6+

### What I learned

- How to manipluate images to add a different style to the body
- Styling the background of the body by sections rather than the whole page at once

### Continued development

- I'll add in new capabilities once I learn React.js
