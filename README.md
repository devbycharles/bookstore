# e-commerce

## Project
- I built this portfolio to showcase my 5 projects

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript ES6+

### What I learned

- How to manipluate images to add a different style to the body
- Styling the background of the body by sections rather than the whole page at once

### Continued development

- I'll add in new capabilities once I learn React.js
